      <p class="infor">Dairy technology course is an engineering discipline which deals with the processing of dairy products. The study covers various domains of collecting, packaging, storing, processing, transporting and distributing dairy products with an understanding of nutrition, bacteriology and biochemistry. Some other principles of chemistry, physics, engineering and economy required for proper utilisation and development of milk and its products are also included in the dairy technology. This course familiarizes the students with the management, sanitation and training techniques of the dairy industry, primarily of India and other countries as well.

    The foundation of Anand Milk Union Ltd, AMUL, in 1946 led to the development of the dairy industry and gave passage to education solely in dairying. Before that, there was not even a single college offering exclusive graduate degree programme in dairying. Traditionally, it was the part of veterinary and animal husbandry courses. The first dairy science college established is the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal (Haryana) which now offers diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate courses in dairy technology. The National Dairy Research Institute has also established modern commercial dairies with the financial support of National Dairy Development Board (NDDB).
